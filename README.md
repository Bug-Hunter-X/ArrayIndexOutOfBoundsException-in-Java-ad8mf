# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in this exception.  The solution is presented in `bugSolution.java`.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to prevent runtime errors.  Always ensure that the index you're using is within the valid range (0 to array.length - 1).
